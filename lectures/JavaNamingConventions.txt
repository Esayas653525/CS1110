Java Naming Conventions


- always use descriptive, self-commenting naming

- variable names shouldn't be too long since you have to reference them a lot

- program/project names, class names & method names are usually a bit longer,
	so they accurately describe WHAT they DO

- use CamelCasing or camelCasing rather than underscores if name is > 1 word
        (except for named-constants) - like:  rawData or phoneNum

- Java is case-sensitive, so once something's named, you have to use it as is

- start with Cap or start with a small letter?
	program/project names 	- start with Cap
	package names 		- start with a small
	class names 		- start with Cap	
	method names 		- start with small
	object names 		- start with small
	variable names 		- start with small
	Java reserved words 	- start with small (must use "as is")
	names from Java library - must use "as is"

- named-constants - use ALL capital letters, like PI
	- if name > 1 word, use underscore to separate words, like TAX_RATE 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- names of variables, constants, objects & classes are usually nouns (or adjectiveNoun)

- method names are usually verbs with the noun they act on, e.g.,
	findNumOfGallons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- names:
	- can contain digits, but not as the 1st char
	- can NOT contain a space
	- can have an underscore (_) or dollar sign ($),
		but generally do NOT use those
